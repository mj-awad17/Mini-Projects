# Mini-Projects
In education, mini projects let students apply theory practically, boosting hands-on skills and problem-solving. In the professional realm, they help test ideas and refine processes on a smaller scale before larger investments. For personal hobbies, mini projects provide a quick, manageable way to explore interests and learn new skills.
